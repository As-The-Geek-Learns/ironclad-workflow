# WorkflowExperiment — Ironclad Development Workflow

## Project Overview

A structured 4-phase development workflow framework (`PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → SHIP`)
that enforces quality gates, AI-powered code review via Google Gemini, and file integrity
tracking. Inspired by Claudikins Kernel, adapted for Cursor IDE.

**Type:** Developer tooling / workflow framework (meant to be adopted into other projects)
**Language:** JavaScript (Node.js)
**Dependencies:** None (zero external packages — pure Node.js)
**Version:** 1.1.0
**License:** MIT

---

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js (no minimum version specified, uses native `crypto`, `fs`, `path`, `https`)
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API (for code review)
- **CLI Tooling:** GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation in ship phase
- **IDE Integration:** Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules`)

## Key Scripts

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run verify` | Full verification: tests + lint + audit + AI review + file hashing |
| `npm run verify:no-ai` | Verification without AI review |
| `npm run ai-review` | Standalone AI code review |
| `npm run ai-review:security` | Security-focused AI review only |
| `npm run ai-review:diff` | AI review of git diff only |
| `npm run ship` | Validate file integrity against verification state |
| `npm run ship:pr` | Validate integrity + create GitHub PR |

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | For AI review | Google Gemini API key |

---

## Development Conventions

- Zero-dependency design — do not add npm packages
- Scripts use only Node.js built-in modules (`crypto`, `fs`, `path`, `https`, `child_process`)
- All file hashing uses SHA256
- AI review uses Gemini 2.5 Flash with temperature 0.2
- File extensions scanned: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`, `.json`

---

## Workflow Phases

1. **PLAN** — Create plan from template, get human approval
2. **EXECUTE** — Feature branch, implement tasks, session docs
3. **VERIFY** — `node scripts/verify.js` (tests, lint, audit, AI review, hashing)
4. **SHIP** — `node scripts/ship.js` (integrity check, PR creation)

Three mandatory human approval gates: after PLAN, after VERIFY, after SHIP.

## Working With This Project

- The `test-project/` directory is a working example — it has its own `package.json`,
  source, tests, and a completed verification state
- Templates in `.workflow/templates/` are meant to be copied, not edited in place
- State files in `.workflow/state/` are generated by scripts — don't hand-edit them
- The `.cursor/rules` file enforces the workflow when using Cursor IDE
